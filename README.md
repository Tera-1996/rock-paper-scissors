Js made game for Rock, Paper and Scissors
The code is commented out for better understanding

This is a made game using JavaScript only. The game is the usual rock, paper, scissors - played against the computer.
It is typically boring, but you can try with friends orrr:

1- download visual studio.
2- create a file rockPaperScissors.js
3- copy paste my hard-work into the file and run the code.
4- you will see the results and will feel as much as boring it is to play against a computer.

Hence: It can be modified for a better gameplay
